# StaticRingBuffer

This project implements static ring buffer, i.e., similar to circular queue.

This is a simple implementation of the datastructure 'Ring Buffer' with fixed buffer-size in C language.

The *'demo_app'* module is just for to test the working of the ring buffer. The only module that is meant to be used is the *'ring_buffer'* module.

:warning: Some of its functions contain *'printf'* statements. Those functions are not meant to be called in an emmbedded project, but only for a desktop project.
